## Usage

### Notification Button

The notification button is located in the header or navigation section. It displays the number of unread notifications in a red badge. When clicked, it shows a dropdown with a list of notifications. Each notification can be marked as read.

### Real-time Updates

- The notification count is updated dynamically using Alpine.js.
- Notifications are fetched periodically (every 30 seconds) or in real-time using Laravel Echo and broadcasting.

### Marking Notifications as Read

- Notifications can be marked as read by clicking the "Mark as Read" button beside each notification.
- You can also mark all notifications as read with a single button.

## Files Structure

- **app/Models/Notification**: Model for handling notifications.
- **resources/views/notifications**: Views for displaying notifications.
- **routes/web.php**: Defines routes for fetching notifications.
- **app/Http/Controllers/NotificationController.php**: Controller for handling the logic of fetching and marking notifications.
